        <section class="content-section">
          <h2>The Challenge of Bias</h2>
          <p>
            Bias is inherent in human thinking and communication. Our brains
            rely on shortcuts and patterns to process information efficiently,
            which often leads to unconscious biases. When AI systems are trained
            on human-generated data, they not only learn to mimic human language
            but also absorb and sometimes amplify these biases.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
          <h2>Human Bias</h2>
          <p>
            Human biases stem from our cognitive limitations, personal
            experiences, and cultural influences. These biases are often subtle
            and unconscious, making them difficult to identify without
            intentional reflection.
          </p>

          <h3>Key characteristics of human bias:</h3>
          <ul class="feature-list">
            <li>Often unconscious and unintentional</li>
            <li>Shaped by personal experience and cultural background</li>
            <li>Evolves over time with new experiences and information</li>
            <li>Can be mitigated through awareness and education</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
          <h2>AI Bias</h2>
          <p>
            AI systems learn patterns from vast amounts of data, including any
            biases present in that data. Unlike humans, AI lacks intrinsic
            awareness of these biases and cannot independently recognize or
            correct them.
          </p>

          <h3>Key characteristics of AI bias:</h3>
          <ul class="feature-list">
            <li>Systematic and often amplified from training data</li>
            <li>Lacks self-awareness to recognize biased outputs</li>
            <li>Can reach millions of users quickly, scaling the impact</li>
            <li>Requires deliberate technical interventions to mitigate</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
          <h2>The Feedback Loop</h2>
          <p>
            When humans interact with biased AI systems without awareness, it
            creates a harmful feedback loop: human biases inform AI training, AI
            systems reinforce those biases, humans consume biased AI outputs,
            and the cycle continues.
          </p>

          <p>
            DeBiasMe aims to break this loop by making biases visible,
            understandable, and actionable. By highlighting potential biases in
            both human prompts and AI responses, users can develop a more
            critical perspective on their interactions with AI systems.
